                <h3>Arm's Length Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        At arm's length<br>
                        But not far enough away<br>
                        Couldn't find the strength<br>
                        To pull you down with me<br>
                        Should've seen your face<br>
                        When the sun stole the half of it<br>
                        Won't you stay up late<br>
                        So I don't miss a thing<br><br>

                        And I'm so used to the same<br>
                        I'll be dragging my feet when I walk away<br><br>

                        The love you sent<br>
                        Couldn't stain a blank slate<br>
                        Would you say your guess<br>
                        Is as good as mine?<br>
                        Don't let me forget<br>
                        'Cause I will<br>
                        If you let me<br>
                        Keep on drawing you from memory<br><br>

                        And I'm so used to the same (to the same)<br>
                        I'll be dragging my feet when I walk<br>
                        You're taking it lightly whenever I talk<br>
                        These grains of salt are starting to clot<br>
                        You take it easy, but it's not<br><br>
                        
                        And I'm grasping at straws 'cause I blew it all down<br>
                        And I'm spelling each word as they come out of my mouth<br>
                        And I'm holding my breath every time that I pass your house<br>
                        And I'm grasping at straws 'cause I blew it all down<br>
                        And I'm spelling each word as they come out of my mouth<br>
                        And I'm holding my breath every time that I pass your house<br><br>

                        And I'm grasping at straws 'cause I blew it all down<br>
                        And I'm spelling each word as they come out of my mouth<br>
                        And I'm holding my breath every time that I pass your house<br>
                        And I'm grasping at straws 'cause I blew it all down (grasping at straws)<br>
                        And I'm spelling each word as they come out of my mouth (spelling each word)<br>
                        And I'm holding my breath every time that I pass your house (holding my breath, house)
