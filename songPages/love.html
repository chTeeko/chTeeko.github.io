                    <p>
                        Well, when you go<br>
                        Don't ever think I'll make you try to stay<br>
                        And maybe when you get back<br>
                        I'll be off to find another way<br><br>

                        And after all this time that you still owe<br>
                        You're still the good-for-nothing, I don't know<br>
                        So take your gloves and get out<br>
                        Better get out<br>
                        While you can<br><br>

                        When you go<br>
                        And would you even turn to say<br>
                        I don't love you<br>
                        Like I did<br>
                        Yesterday<br><br>

                        Sometimes I cry so hard from pleading<br>
                        So sick and tired of all the needless beating<br>
                        But baby, when they knock you<br>
                        Down and out<br>
                        It's where you oughta stay<br><br>

                        And after all the blood that you still owe<br>
                        Another dollar's just another blow<br>
                        So fix your eyes and get up<br>
                        Better get up<br>
                        While you can<br>
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa<br><br>

                        When you go<br>
                        And would you even turn to say<br>
                        I don't love you<br>
                        Like I did<br>
                        Yesterday<br>
                        Well, come on, come on<br><br>

                        When you go<br>
                        Would you have the guts to say<br>
                        I don't love you<br>
                        Like I loved you yesterday?<br><br>

                        I don't love you<br>
                        Like I loved you yesterday<br>
                        I don't love you<br>
                        Like I loved you yesterday
                    </p>
