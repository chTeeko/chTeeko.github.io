                <h3>Watercolour Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        So crumple these paper buildings and taint watercolour skies<br>
                        I guess the paint hasn't dried yet<br>
                        And nothing feels real it's something I cannot describe<br>
                        It's just something I have dealt with<br>
                        And all things come to pass, the sun is up again<br><br>
                        In your face, I see now; a need for new lease on life<br>
                        Yeah, you're just happy to be here<br>
                        If knowing's a battle, my mind cannot choose a side<br>
                        So drop the things that you hold dear<br>
                        You're swearing on your life, I've got it all to lose this time<br><br>
                        This morning I told you I couldn't be there on time<br>
                        Said "You sound just like your father"<br>
                        I'm blind past my fingers and I'm ignoring all the signs<br>
                        As my memory falters, is this all by your design<br>
                        I am your son, I do not shine<br><br>
                        You sat bedside, our smallest fingers intertwined<br>
                        And you can leave it all behind<br>
                        I am your son, I do not shine<br>
                        My heart meets my throat as I try and bide my time<br>
                        This is all by your design, I am your son I cannot shine
                    </p>
