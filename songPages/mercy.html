                <h3>Playing Mercy Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Explain the paranormal<br>
                        Or just tell me what you saw<br>
                        You're having dreams about the silhouettes you draw<br>
                        And you're still laying low<br>
                        But you are hardly missing anything at all<br>
                        It's like the fear of missing out has met its match<br>
                        When you're what's missing<br><br>

                        I spent my best years playing mercy with your ghost<br>
                        You'll never beat me but you're getting really close<br>
                        And you're crushing up my pills<br>
                        I'm scared to swallow<br>
                        (I slow the speed of sound, coming from your mouth)<br>
                        But I always choke<br>
                        And you beg to differ<br><br>

                        I matched my breath with your breath<br>
                        I do it just for fun<br>
                        You'd like to think I'm counting<br>
                        Each and every one<br>
                        But I lost my focus<br><br>

                        You call my name<br>
                        With a tin can on a string<br>
                        You can count on me<br>
                        But fuck, who's counting?<br>
                        You always said<br>
                        You'd be crying if you could<br>
                        I knew what you meant<br>
                        But I still wish you would (I still wish you would)<br><br>

                        I spent my best years playing mercy with your ghost<br>
                        You'll never beat me but you're getting really close<br>
                        And you're crushing up my pills<br>
                        I'm scared to swallow<br>
                        (I slow the speed of sound, coming from your mouth)<br>
                        But I always choke<br>
                        And you beg to differ<br><br>

                        If I knew half the things you know<br>
                        I'd never shut the fuck up, oh<br>
                        You only slept right in the cold<br>
                        Shoot for the sky until someone goes<br><br>

                        I wrote it down so I'd remember<br>
                        I need to write my thoughts down more<br>
                        But I can barely read my own damn writing<br>
                        I've always rathered reading yours<br>
                        I've always rathered reading yours<br><br>

                        Begged them to burn your body<br>
                        They buried you instead<br>
                        Said you couldn't tell the difference when you're dead<br>

                        When I'm scared to swallow<br>
                        Where you go, I'll follow<br>
                        I'll follow
                    </p>
