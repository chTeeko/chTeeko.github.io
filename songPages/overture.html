                <h3>Overture Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm breaking bones<br>
                        And you're signing my cast<br>
                        "That's exactly how you'll wind up dead"<br><br>

                        I am blessed to be home<br>
                        I'm possessed by my past<br>
                        Put a roof over my rotten head<br><br>

                        You know exactly where I'll go when I'm gone<br>
                        Know that it's been in the works for so long<br>
                        Born and raised tending to our trauma bond<br>
                        Because you know that it's all we've got<br><br>

                        Getting better with names<br>
                        But still struggling with faces<br>
                        And facing the worst I can be<br><br>

                        And I've been reasoning with<br>
                        All my reasons to live<br>
                        But I still got more reasons to leave<br><br>

                        You know exactly where I'll go when I'm gone<br>
                        Know that it's been in the works for so long<br>
                        Born and raised tending to our trauma bond<br>
                        Because you know that it's all we've got<br><br>

                        Oh, please stay as long as you'd like<br>
                        Back to old ways, just like riding a bike<br>
                        You pray just in case of any afterlife<br>
                        And you call just in case I'm dead<br><br>

                        A face only a mother could love<br>
                        But she can hardly even look at her son<br>
                        Living lonely<br>
                        I won't hurt anyone<br>
                        I won't hurt anyone
                    </p>
