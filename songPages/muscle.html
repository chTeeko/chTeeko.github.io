                <h3>Muscle Memory Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Struggling to finish the stories I tell<br>
                        An extra pillow to prop me up when I'm unwell<br>
                        You are<br>
                        Always up in arms<br>
                        But it just made sense to me<br><br>

                        Was feeling sorry for myself 'cause I can't see clear<br>
                        Find it tough to forgive when you're so self-aware<br>
                        Can you<br>
                        Spell it out for me<br>
                        Until it's muscle memory?<br><br>

                        You wrote off your pride<br>
                        And I wrote you a letter<br>
                        If you have the time<br>
                        I wish you'd live forever<br>
                        The cloud in your head<br>
                        Is changing the weather<br><br>

                        And how I come across<br>
                        Looks better on paper<br>
                        I can't tell apart sooner from later<br>
                        It's the type of loss that can swing in your favour<br><br>

                        You wrote off your pride<br>
                        And I wrote you a letter<br>
                        If you have the time<br>
                        I wish you'd live forever<br>
                        The cloud in your head<br>
                        Is changing the weather<br><br>

                        Depersonalized, or simply self-centered?<br><br>

                        And how I come across<br>
                        Looks better on paper<br>
                        I can't tell apart sooner from later<br>
                        It's the type of loss that can swing in your favour (Your favour)<br><br>

                        You wrote off your pride<br>
                        And I wrote you a letter<br>
                        If you have the time<br>
                        I wish you'd live forever<br><br>

                        You wrote off your pride<br>
                        And I wrote you a letter<br>
                        If you have the time<br>
                        I wish you'd live forever
                    </p>
