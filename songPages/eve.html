                <h3>Eve (household name) Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        The holidays are all going down the same<br>
                        When you asked me what I wished for<br>
                        And I told you I'd never say<br><br>

                        Said I wish you were here<br>
                        Or at least that you weren't there<br>
                        You cover your ears<br>
                        'Cause you long to be less aware<br><br>

                        And now that time has healed all of my wounds<br>
                        I fear I'm too old to remember<br>
                        What I got myself into<br><br>

                        And these days, I'm not a colour but a shade<br>
                        You said it's only building character<br>
                        Find out the harder way<br>
                        And all the same<br>
                        I'm reflecting light from everything<br>
                        You wouldn't notice if I'm thinner<br>
                        Because you see me everyday<br><br>

                        Forgotten but never gone<br>
                        Old stories you pass along<br>
                        I'd rather have bad luck than none<br>
                        Curse 'cause it's in a song<br>
                        I'm so fucking in the wrong<br>
                        Swallow the said and done<br><br>

                        Wincing and whining<br>
                        I've got no room to run<br>
                        Ask anyone<br>
                        I don't know where I'm from anymore<br>
                        Anymore<br><br>

                        So pretend you can't hear<br>
                        It's not your fault just your failure<br>
                        Promise me like a kid<br>
                        Swear to me like a sailor<br>
                        I'll just change, rearrange<br>
                        All your tectonic plates<br>
                        And your head<br>
                        Won't shake again<br><br>

                        The holidays are all going down the same<br>
                        When you asked me what I wished for<br>
                        And I told you I'd never say<br><br>

                        You startle easier than I did at your age<br>
                        'Cause you put the bliss in ignorance<br>
                        You were my household name
                    </p>
