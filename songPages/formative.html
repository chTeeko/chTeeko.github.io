                <h3>Formative Age Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm not concerned that you'd kill for me<br>
                        But you don't even live for me<br>
                        I beg you to get out of bed<br>
                        You spoke only in similes<br>
                        And smiled at the symmetry<br>
                        Whatever made sense in your head<br>
                        You said<br><br>

                        Don't let me know you got home<br>
                        Man, I wanna feel more alone<br>
                        Don't hold out hope<br>
                        Hold your hands around my throat<br>
                        Your days are numbered and you know<br>
                        (You're waxing and waning)<br>
                        Torn picking between your skin and bones<br>
                        (You flicker, you're fading)<br><br>

                        Now you're winding me up and I'm twirling and dancing inside of your music box dreams<br>
                        Learning to love from the men in my family only gets you so far it seems<br><br>

                        Don't let me know you got home<br>
                        Man, I wanna feel more alone<br>
                        Don't hold out hope<br>
                        Hold your hands around my throat<br>
                        Your days are numbered and you know<br>
                        (You're waxing and waning)<br>
                        Torn picking between your skin and bones<br>
                        (You flicker, you're fading)<br><br>

                        How many times am I told<br>
                        I won't go through it alone<br>
                        When there's nothing I want more?<br>
                        Here, you'll always have a home<br><br>

                        I think I found what I needed just as you were leaving<br>
                        Guess you would've had to have been there to believe it, I know<br>
                        If you could bring anyone, who would you bring?<br>
                        Each lower-case city and bad hiding place<br>
                        If you're like this with everyone, I swear that's okay<br>
                        I'm the intrusive thought that you can't shake away<br><br>

                        And I'll give you my jacket, you can call me old fashioned, oh<br>
                        I'm just an accident waiting to happen, oh no<br><br>

                        'Cause I'm bound to go braindead or better, insane<br>
                        And there's no guarantee you would love me the same<br>
                        Put me up on your shoulders, I've been standing all day<br>
                        Crooked, craning my neck at a formative age<br><br>

                        I was taught slow and steady but I'm running on empty<br>
                        You said I miss you already<br>
                        Are my hands too heavy to hold?<br><br>

                        It's like I'm walking on eggshells inside of my brain<br>
                        A minefield of memories<br>
                        I'm stuck in one place
                    </p>
