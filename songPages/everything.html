                    <p>
                        I let you in and you took everything as I knew it<br>
                        And you wore out my name 'cause you swore I was going to lose it<br>
                        Still, if I had the choice I would take out my voice from the music<br>
                        So when days feel the same I can paint on a face for amusement<br>
                        Well, you marked up my walls, told me that I looked small at the waistline<br>
                        You said what's your excuse, I took up too much room for the first time<br><br>

                        I've got too much on my plate<br>
                        I haven't eaten in days<br>
                        But I feel fine<br>
                        I'm just worried and wondering why<br><br>

                        If you notice me limping<br>
                        Well, would you still take me in?<br>
                        Like baby teeth nibbling<br>
                        Falling out when they break your skin<br>
                        How many blocks make a building?<br>
                        How many times 'til it's effortless?<br>
                        But who am I kidding<br>
                        When my wit's not so quick?<br><br>

                        Well, it pours when it rains<br>
                        You were left out all day, you were shaking<br>
                        And you're making your mark pushing everything hard on the pavement<br><br>

                        Well, I let you in and you took everything just to take it (Just to take it)<br>
                        And you wore out my name because you know how I ache when you say it, oh<br>
                        Yeah, you know how I ache when you say it, oh
                    </p>
