                <h3>Garamond Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        You procrastinated sleep<br>
                        So you sought out to make it routine<br>
                        I thought being this numb was me toughening up<br>
                        You stitched the back of your corduroys<br><br>
                        I'm withdrawn from the ways that you are<br>
                        Stuck in a dream state of the art<br>
                        I went with my gut and I threw it all up<br>
                        So dig your thumbs into my pressure points<br><br>
                        You're always leaving the light on<br>
                        I'm leaving before it gets bad<br>
                        And if it's what you want<br>
                        Why do you look like that?<br>
                        I will bend over backwards<br>
                        To keep what you've got here intact<br><br>
                        Who will die in my lifetime?<br>
                        You'd rather pass in your sleep<br><br>
                        I'm losing my way with words<br>
                        Sentences scattered and slurred<br>
                        Hope the last breath I breathe is a sigh of relief<br>
                        With your past on a pedestal<br><br>
                        Should I fall off of the face of the earth?<br>
                        Or rinse with salt, just so it doesn't hurt?<br>
                        I've said it once, said it twice<br>
                        I've spoiled everything nice<br>
                        Shutting down summer solstice<br>
                        To make a shorter schedule<br><br>
                        You're always leaving the light on<br>
                        I'm leaving before it gets bad<br>
                        And if it's what you want<br>
                        Why do you look like that?<br>
                        I will bend over backwards<br>
                        To keep what you've got here intact, intact<br><br>
                        If I treat every thought like a stab in the back<br>
                        I will write out my last words<br>
                        I'll save every wishbone you snapped<br>
                        You snapped<br><br>
                        You're always leaving the light on<br>
                        I'm leaving before it gets bad<br>
                        And if it's what you want<br>
                        Why do you look like that?<br>
                        I will bend over backwards<br>
                        To keep what you've got here intact
                    </p>
