                <h3>Safer Skin Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Your words lingered on my lips like<br>
                        Your breath when in the cold<br>
                        You captured me in smoke tendrils and<br>
                        Stories that you told<br>
                        It's so unlike you to bring back these memories of old<br>
                        I thought to keep you safer here to some fault of my own<br><br>

                        You are the wind in tall grass<br>
                        The lighting shift in hours passed<br>
                        Some bones are meant to crack<br>
                        Stuck in the shadows you cast<br>
                        (In the shadows you cast)<br><br>

                        Rough around the edges from cutting every corner thin<br>
                        And so I became dull to try and give you safer skin<br>
                        I swore I wouldn't feel a thing<br>
                        And I swear I never did<br>
                        I let myself fall out<br>
                        I know that there's a way back in<br>
                        There always is<br>
                        There always is<br><br>

                        Quantity is quality when days are wearing thin<br>
                        Nothing's ever up to me<br>
                        I just keep breathing in<br>
                        And if you'd save a spot for me<br>
                        I'd tell you everything<br>
                        Anything you want to be<br>
                        But never what you think (yeah)<br><br>

                        Quantity is quality when days are wearing thin<br>
                        Nothing's ever up to me<br>
                        I just keep breathing in<br>
                        I just keep breathing in
                    </p>
