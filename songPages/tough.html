                    <p>
                        What if this all pans out like you said<br>
                        And I outlive all my family and friends?<br><br>
                        What's up?<br>
                        Well, nothing much<br>
                        I've been losing touch the past few months<br>
                        It's all at once<br>
                        Or only for a moment<br><br>
                        You loved the smell of the smoke until it got in your clothes<br>
                        I've got some skin that I won't ever show<br><br>
                        What if this all pans out like you said<br>
                        And I outlive all my family and friends?<br>
                        And if they don't reach out, we'll never speak again<br>
                        Well, don't let it get to your head<br>
                        But where else would it get?<br><br>
                        Take a picture<br>
                        'Cause it lasts longer than your brain<br>
                        I've got a photographic memory<br>
                        But each picture is of your face<br><br>
                        You stopped believing in ghosts<br>
                        Now you just haunt broken homes<br>
                        I've got some skin that I won't ever show<br>
                        The short end of every wishbone<br><br>
                        What if this all pans out like you said<br>
                        And I outlive all my family and friends<br>
                        If they don't reach out we'll never speak again<br>
                        Well, don't let it get to your head<br>
                        But where else would it get?<br><br>
                        What's up?<br>
                        Well, nothing much<br>
                        I've been losing touch<br>
                        The past few months<br>
                        It's all at once<br>
                        Or only for a moment<br>
                        A moment<br><br>
                        And how the fuck<br>
                        Do you show tough love?<br>
                        I'm not that tough<br>
                        I can't take much<br>
                        Is it just my luck?<br><br>
                        What if this all pans out like you said<br>
                        And I outlive all my family and friends<br>
                        And I can't believe I'm doing this again<br>
                        When everyday is a new means to an end<br>
                        I never got used to it
                    </p>
