                <h3>Aries (moth song) Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        you flew around<br>
                        where my light goes<br>
                        and you’re chewing holes<br>
                        in all my clothes<br><br>

                        i let you out<br>
                        thought you’d go home<br>
                        but you said your home<br>
                        is where i go<br><br>

                        am i precious or just delicate?<br>
                        born with bargain-basement bones<br>
                        and you know that<br><br>

                        when your white blood cells<br>
                        can’t count on you<br>
                        know they’ll come for you soon<br>
                        you’re numb, but not immune<br><br>

                        you think fondly of the times<br>
                        we burned smilies on our thighs<br>
                        safe where no one else could see them,<br>
                        just as long as you saw mine<br>
                        just as long as you saw mine<br><br>

                        you hold out hope<br>
                        and put stock in star signs<br>
                        with a telescope<br>
                        to see if you’re right<br><br>

                        a product of pity sex,<br>
                        but a miracle no less<br>
                        you said you’re not even that scary<br>
                        wouldn’t have pegged you as an aries,<br>
                        i guess<br><br>

                        when your white blood cells<br>
                        can’t count on you<br>
                        know they’ll come for you soon<br>
                        you’re numb, but not immune<br><br>

                        you connect my dots<br>
                        & my beauty spots<br>
                        til you’re seeing stars<br>
                        wherever i could not<br><br>

                        made out a little spoon<br>
                        said it’s just like you<br>
                        a constellation curse<br>
                        waning phase honeymoon<br>
                        gone too soon<br><br>

                        trying to look<br>
                        more like my skeleton<br>
                        i’d do anything to show<br>
                        we’re not so different<br>

                        when you drink to drown<br>
                        in your own puke,<br>
                        i’ll breathe life back into you.<br>
                        there’s nothing i wouldn’t do<br><br>

                        and when i leave, you’re so confused<br>
                        like a baby in the other room<br>
                        i’ll just pretend like i don’t hear you<br>
                        but we both know i always do<br>
                        we both know i always do
                    </p>
