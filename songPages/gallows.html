                <h3>Gallows Humor Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        You made it a habit to breathe through your chest,<br>
                        Your skin tailored too tightly, your bones kept arrest<br>
                        Finding the worst in the best<br><br>

                        I can't help but notice you're losing your voice,<br>
                        Pins and needles persist as you walk on white noise<br>
                        You used to be bitter by choice<br><br>

                        List the things you love<br>
                        Cross out every one<br>
                        You sat still as you should<br>
                        And watched the decor hit the living room floor<br><br>

                        Count the corners of<br>
                        Your steepest obstacles<br>
                        And like father like son<br>
                        You're pulling when push comes to shove<br>
                        You needed more<br><br>

                        Stepping back through the hoops you set out in good times<br>
                        Well you grew and you grew in yourself, you're confined<br>
                        Turning your chin to the sky<br><br>

                        Let this god-given guilt<br>
                        Grace the weight on my shoulder blades<br>
                        In third person I struggle for one point of view<br>
                        Colour code my perception of you<br><br>

                        List the things you love<br>
                        Cross out every one<br>
                        You sat still as you should<br>
                        And watched the decor hit the living room floor<br><br>

                        Count the corners of<br>
                        Your steepest obstacles<br>
                        And like father like son<br>
                        You're pulling when push comes to shove<br><br>

                        I've got too much to live for<br>
                        It's just getting heavier<br>
                        Forget all the features of each face I meet<br>
                        Wish me away like a dandelion seed
                    </p>
