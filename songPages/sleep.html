                <h3>No Sleep Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pushed away with all your might<br>
                        Is it bad<br>
                        If you want them back?<br>
                        So you relied on your hindsight<br>
                        You had it all<br>
                        But it's all you had<br><br>

                        Dig yourself deeper like a lie<br>
                        I'm moving slow<br>
                        I'm fast asleep<br>
                        Double knotting all the ties<br>
                        To the friends I had in 2016<br><br>

                        And the showers brought May flowers to their waiting room<br>
                        (Your name in italics a product of habit)<br>
                        Vase half full with holy water<br>
                        You were holy too<br>
                        (A swan song in static so melodramatic)<br><br>

                        And you couldn't put it better with them holding your tongue<br>
                        I'll just say I can't remember because I don't like who I was<br>
                        Cold to the touch and never warm enough<br><br>

                        So you've settled on sleeping forever<br>
                        Mark my height with pen and measure<br>
                        An older soul, was weary in my youth<br>
                        No daylight to waste<br>
                        No sleep left to lose<br><br>

                        You looked over my last effort to assert<br>
                        (Speak for yourself you have my word)<br>
                        No, it's never been quite like me to be firm<br>
                        (And even still what's mine is yours)<br><br>

                        'Cause I haven't felt right in such a long time<br>
                        And there's no sleep left to lose<br>
                        Just fucking static all the time<br><br>

                        And the showers brought May flowers to their waiting room<br>
                        (Your name in italics a product of habit)<br>
                        Needed a figure like a father just like salt in your wounds<br>
                        (A swan song in static so melodramatic)<br><br>

                        You said I wouldn't feel it when you picked me up by the scruff<br>
                        Perfect posture starts to bow when the weight piles up<br>
                        Cold to the touch and never warm enough<br>
                        Warm enough
                    </p>
