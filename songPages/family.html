                <h3>Family amd Friends Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        When you said you never want to take my name, well I completely understood<br>
                        You'll pass with your eyes open<br>
                        You were hoping<br>
                        I could close them shut<br><br>

                        You could've sworn that we've met<br>
                        Just like déjà vu death<br>
                        But home has never been a roof over your head<br><br>

                        But wouldn't it be nice<br>
                        To not have to tell me twice?<br>
                        Love in a different language<br>
                        Where we speak every second night<br><br>

                        When you had every right<br>
                        To want to take your life<br>
                        But you've earned all your anguish<br><br>

                        And I think I'm coming down with something strange<br>
                        And if I'm being fair<br>
                        I hope I'm coming down with something<br>
                        Because I'm never here and I'm barely ever there<br>
                        I bet my family and friends<br>
                        Could all fit in this bed<br>
                        But they'll never spend the night 'cause I scare them all to death<br><br>

                        But wouldn't it be nice<br>
                        To not have to tell me twice<br>
                        Love in a different language<br>
                        Where we speak every second night<br><br>

                        And you thawed out the thin ice<br>
                        I've been slipping on for life<br>
                        Now I'll tread in water stagnant<br>
                        I'm getting nowhere nice<br><br>

                        A familiar face from forever ago<br>
                        A vow to be silent and do what you're told<br>
                        If you know how it ends don't let me know<br><br>

                        No don't let me know<br>
                        But wouldn't it be nice<br>
                        To not have to tell me twice<br>
                        Love in a different language<br>
                        Where we speak every second night<br><br>

                        And you had every right<br>
                        To want to take your life<br>
                        But you've earned all your anguish
                    </p>
