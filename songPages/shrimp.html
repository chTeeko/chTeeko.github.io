                <h3>Really Big Shrimp Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        I didn’t expect a thing<br>
                        The soundtrack for too many beers<br>
                        Seven songs in two years<br>
                        And somehow you’re not bored yet<br><br>

                        Forgive my apprehension<br>
                        I just wanna keep this safe<br>
                        That’s forty ounces of faith<br>
                        And not a drop was poured yet<br>
                        That’s why I say<br><br>

                        Love? Don't give me that.<br>
                        Till I can give you something back<br><br>

                        Why would I say no?<br>
                        To my dream from forever ago<br>
                        You want me to get up and go?<br>
                        Let me pull back the curtain:<br><br>

                        There’s a couch with my name on it<br>
                        In front of my face, a phone.<br>
                        In front of my “body” a “home”.<br>
                        A world where consistency is certain<br><br>

                        That's why I say<br><br>

                        Love? Don't give me that.<br>
                        Till I can give you something back<br>
                        No proof in tact<br>
                        Won’t have me sold and I will<br>
                        Fold myself in half<br>
                        Before i snap and I will hold<br>
                        Myself to that<br>
                        Until I give you something back<br><br>

                        I cleared the bar I set. What more could I achieve?<br>
                        I know this room so well that I’m afraid to leave<br>
                        I just wanna cut my teeth a few more times<br>
                        Keep away from tempting signs<br>
                        Make no friends and take no risks<br>
                        So no one gets to fuck with this<br><br>

                        I cherish a time<br>
                        When nobody paid attention<br>
                        And i sang and i played and i vented<br>
                        And twenty-five people shrugged<br><br>

                        I cherish a life<br>
                        Before the sudden potential<br>
                        For twenty-five minutes im special<br>
                        As soon as they’re over I'm not.
