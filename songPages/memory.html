                <h3>In Loving Memory Lyrics</h3>
                    <p>
                        when trying hard not to remember makes you think about it more<br>
                        i stand up straight, you measure, and you mark it on the door<br>
                        never saw you walk on water<br>
                        but i watched you mother four<br>
                        you couldn’t raise me like a father<br>
                        when we’re choking on our child support<br><br>
                        am i smart<br>
                        or just thinking really hard?<br>
                        destined for dementia,<br>
                        doomed right from the very start<br>
                        our trauma bond was tangled<br>
                        in tape from the vcr<br>
                        so sick to my stomach<br>
                        i was forcefed the fear of the dark<br><br>
                        when you lose all muscle memory<br>
                        and you forget completely how to stand,<br>
                        you know i won’t let you forget me<br>
                        i’ll come convince you who i am<br>
                        i’ll make you understand<br><br>
                        touch and go,<br>
                        now you see me now you don’t<br>
                        phantom limb affection<br>
                        crave the feeling<br>
                        of your ghost<br><br>
                        you’re forging all the symptoms that you<br>
                        never had supposed<br>
                        you learned to live with them<br>
                        said it’s easier to live alone<br><br>
                        sick from the soothing,<br>
                        drowning in dreams,<br>
                        shellshocked in shelter,<br>
                        you’ll pass in your sleep<br><br>
                        the thorn in my side was grown from your ground<br>
                        you are never before seen, never again found<br><br>
                        i came to see<br>
                        how the world looks without me<br>
                        is it all you thought it’d be?<br>
                        living in loving memory<br><br>
                        you built me a home inside a bucket<br>
                        and you’re poking some holes up top so i can breathe<br>
                        knew i was lying<br>
                        when i had to look away<br><br>
                        do you think we’d be friends when we were younger?<br>
                        if i knew you back then, god knows who i would be<br>
                        walking in semi circles<br>
                        to shape this baby face<br><br>
                        a picture portrait of you, you’re pouting<br>
                        plucked from the days where you couldn’t feel a thing<br>
                        a thousand words and always counting<br>
                        but you, i can’t explain
                    </p>
